**Anne Boleyn** was born 1501 or 1507 was the queen of England from 1533 to 1536, and the 2nd wife of **King Henry VIII**. She was executed because of the reason treason, **she was beheaded in the tower of London on May 19, 1536 at the age of 29 or 35**.

Anne was the daughter of **Thomas Boleyn**, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, and his wife, **Elizabeth Howard**. And she had an older sister named **Mary Boleyn**. Early in 1523, **Anne was secretly betrothed to Henry Percy**, son of Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, but **the betrothal was broken off when the Earl refused to support their engagement**. In February or March 1526, Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne. She resisted his attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, as her sister Mary had previously been. When Wolsey failed to obtain an annulment of Henry's marriage from Pope Clement VII, it became clear that the marriage would not be annulled by the Catholic Church. As a result, Henry and his advisers, such as Thomas Cromwell, began the breaking of the Church's power in England and closing the monasteries and the nunneries. In 1532, Henry made Anne the Marquess of Pembroke in her own right.

Henry and Anne formally married on 25 January 1533, after a secret wedding on 14 November 1532. **Anne was crowned Queen of England on June 1, 1533**. On **7 September, she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I**. Henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son, but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth. Anne subsequently **had three miscarriages and by March 1536, because Henry was courting Jane Seymour**. Henry VIII had Anne investigated for high treason in April 1536. On **2 May, she was arrested and sent to the Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers, she was convicted on 15 May and beheaded four days later**. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest with her brother George, and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing.
